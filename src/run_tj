Ok gang, I have a COSMOS test field up and running with wphotpm.  Some 150 frames (per band) gives a coverage of mid-20's or so  (and a few odd with huge coverage, in the 50's).   This ~20's coverage is similar to the allwise coverage.

coadds:  from the archive; 1497p015_ac51
frames:   from the archive, i downloaded zillions 
mdet:   from you guys, either Peter or Nelson provided : 1497p015_ac51-mdet-raw-1234-2.400.tbl
psfs:  surveypsfs-032814


Photometric and (static) astrometric results look nominal compared to ALLWISE.  I would say the code is working fine.   I have not looked at the PM stuff, I'll let JWF do that.

(note however:  there is still the mag offset for wpro photometry, which otherwise looks fine;  this is either a zero point issue, or a normalization issue;  should flesh out once I start modifying code;  wapp is nominal;  one other mystery I'm not sure about :   mdet table has some 64K sources, but only 24K sources are extracted from wphotom ... maybe too low S/N ??  must be tracked down ***)

*** Follow up:   used more frames, ~200, and the extraction was much higher, ~48K
which means the coadd footprint is better covered with more frames.  the typical coverage per pixel is 25 or so.
So things are looking nominal with wphotpm.
